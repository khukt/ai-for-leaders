# Preface

## Why This Book Exists

AI is no longer a technology topic. It is a leadership topic.

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has moved from research labs and data science teams into board rooms, legal departments, policy discussions, and strategic plans. Executives are being asked to approve AI investments, govern AI systems, manage AI-related risks, and lead organisations through AI-driven transformation — often without the technical background to evaluate what they're approving.

This book was written to close that gap.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for executives, directors, policymakers, and senior managers who need to make decisions about AI — and who want to make those decisions well.

You do not need a technical background. You do not need to understand machine learning algorithms or neural network architectures. What you need is a clear framework for thinking about AI as a leadership challenge: where it creates value, where it creates risk, and how to govern it responsibly.

## What This Book Covers

The book is organised into four core areas:

1. **AI Landscape** — What AI is, what it can and cannot do, and what is changing now
2. **AI Regulation & Penalties** — The legal and regulatory environment, and the financial consequences of non-compliance
3. **AI Strategy** — How to evaluate, prioritise, and invest in AI initiatives
4. **AI Governance** — How to build accountability structures, oversee vendors, and manage risk

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter is designed to stand alone. You can read from beginning to end, or jump to the chapter most relevant to your current challenge.

Where possible, each chapter ends with a short set of questions you can use to assess your own organisation's maturity in that area.
