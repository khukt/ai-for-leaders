# AI Strategy

## Strategy Before Technology

The most common mistake organisations make with AI is starting with the technology and working backwards to the problem. They invest in AI platforms, hire data science teams, and launch proofs of concept — and then struggle to demonstrate business value.

Effective AI strategy starts with the question: **where does AI create genuine value for our organisation?**

## The AI Value Framework

AI creates value in three ways:

### 1. Automation
Replacing human effort in repetitive, rules-based tasks. This is the most straightforward value driver and often the easiest to quantify.

Examples: document processing, customer service routing, compliance checking.

### 2. Augmentation
Enhancing human judgment by providing better information, faster analysis, or broader perspective.

Examples: clinical decision support, fraud analyst tools, market intelligence dashboards.

### 3. Innovation
Creating new products, services, or business models that were not previously possible.

Examples: personalised medicine, predictive maintenance as a service, AI-native financial products.

## Prioritising AI Investments

Not all AI opportunities are equal. When evaluating AI initiatives, consider:

**Value potential**
- How large is the addressable problem?
- How directly does it connect to revenue, cost, or risk?

**Feasibility**
- Do we have the data required?
- Do we have or can we build the capability?
- Is the technology mature enough to rely on?

**Risk**
- What happens when the system fails?
- What regulatory constraints apply?
- What are the reputational consequences if it goes wrong?

## Build, Buy, or Partner?

Most organisations face a make-or-buy decision for AI capabilities:

| Approach | When it makes sense | Risks |
|---|---|---|
| **Build** | Competitive differentiation, unique data, long-term core capability | High cost, slow, talent competition |
| **Buy** | Commodity capability, fast time-to-value, limited internal expertise | Vendor dependency, limited customisation |
| **Partner** | Shared risk, co-development, industry consortia | Governance complexity, IP issues |

## The Role of Data

AI is only as good as its data. Before investing in AI capabilities, leaders should assess:

- **Data availability**: Do we have the data the AI system needs?
- **Data quality**: Is it accurate, complete, and consistent?
- **Data governance**: Can we use this data legally and ethically?

## Key Questions for Leaders

- Where are we currently investing in AI, and what is the expected business value?
- Do we have a prioritisation framework for AI investments?
- What is our data strategy, and does it support our AI ambitions?
