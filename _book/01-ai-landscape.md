# AI Landscape

## What AI Is — and What It Is Not

Artificial intelligence is a set of techniques that allow computers to perform tasks that previously required human intelligence. These include recognising images, understanding language, making predictions, and generating content.

What AI is **not** is a single, unified technology. The term "AI" encompasses a wide range of approaches, capabilities, and limitations. Understanding those differences matters for leadership decision-making.

## The Three Waves of AI

**First wave: Rules-based systems (1980s–2000s)**  
Early AI systems followed explicit rules written by humans. They were powerful in narrow domains but brittle — unable to handle situations their designers had not anticipated.

**Second wave: Machine learning (2000s–2020s)**  
Instead of following rules, machine learning systems learn patterns from data. This made AI far more flexible and scalable. Applications include fraud detection, recommendation engines, and predictive maintenance.

**Third wave: Foundation models and generative AI (2020s–present)**  
Large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models are trained on vast datasets and can perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific training. This has dramatically lowered the cost of building AI applications and raised the ceiling of what AI can do.

## What Has Changed

Three changes have made AI a leadership priority:

1. **Cost** — The cost of building and deploying AI has fallen dramatically. Tasks that previously required teams of specialists can now be automated with off-the-shelf tools.
2. **Capability** — AI can now perform tasks — writing, summarising, analysing, reasoning — that were considered exclusively human domains.
3. **Speed** — AI adoption is accelerating across industries, creating competitive pressure that leadership teams cannot ignore.

## What AI Still Cannot Do

Despite rapid progress, AI has important limitations:

- **Reliable reasoning**: AI systems can generate plausible-sounding answers that are wrong.
- **Judgment under uncertainty**: AI performs poorly in genuinely novel situations with no precedent in its training data.
- **Accountability**: AI systems do not bear responsibility for their outputs — the organisations deploying them do.

## Key Questions for Leaders

- Which AI capabilities are genuinely relevant to our industry and business model?
- Where is AI already being used in our organisation, with or without central oversight?
- What assumptions are our teams making about AI reliability that need to be tested?
