# AI Governance

## What AI Governance Is

AI governance is the set of policies, processes, roles, and accountability structures that ensure AI systems are developed and used responsibly.

It is not a compliance exercise. It is a management discipline — one that becomes more important as AI becomes more central to how organisations operate.

## Why Governance Fails

Most organisations already have some form of AI governance in place. Most of those governance frameworks are not working well. Common failure modes include:

- **Governance as paperwork**: Policies exist but are not embedded in how teams actually work.
- **Governance as a gate**: Reviews slow down delivery without adding value.
- **Governance without teeth**: Issues are identified but not escalated or resolved.
- **Governance without coverage**: High-profile systems are reviewed; the long tail of AI tools and automations is not.

## The Components of Effective AI Governance

### 1. Inventory and Classification
You cannot govern what you cannot see. Effective AI governance starts with knowing what AI systems exist, who is responsible for them, and what risk category they fall into.

### 2. Risk Assessment
Not all AI systems require the same level of oversight. A risk-based approach focuses governance effort where it matters most:
- What decisions does this system influence?
- Who is affected, and how?
- What is the consequence of failure?

### 3. Human Oversight
High-risk AI systems should have defined points at which humans review, challenge, or override AI outputs. Oversight should be meaningful — not a checkbox that people skip when under pressure.

### 4. Monitoring and Audit
AI systems change over time — data drifts, models degrade, the world changes. Governance requires ongoing monitoring, not just one-time approval.

### 5. Accountability Structures
Someone must be accountable for each AI system's performance and compliance. This typically requires:
- A **technical owner** responsible for system performance
- A **business owner** responsible for use and outcomes
- A **governance function** that sets standards and conducts reviews

## Vendor Oversight

Most organisations use AI systems built by third parties. Vendor oversight is a critical but often neglected part of AI governance.

Key questions for vendor oversight:
- What AI is embedded in our vendor's products and services?
- What access do we have to model cards, testing results, and incident reports?
- Who is contractually responsible when the vendor's AI causes harm?

## The Board's Role

AI governance is increasingly a board-level responsibility. Boards should expect:
- Regular reporting on AI risk exposure
- Clear escalation paths for significant AI failures
- Evidence that management has an adequate governance framework in place

## Key Questions for Leaders

- Do we have a complete inventory of AI systems in use across our organisation?
- Is accountability for each AI system clearly assigned?
- How do we oversee AI systems provided by third-party vendors?
- When did our board last receive a report on AI risk?
